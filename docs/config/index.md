# Configuration

Dumi is based on Umi, and the configuration way is the same as the Umi. It can be configured in `.umirc.js` or `config/config.js`. The content is as follows:

```js
// configuration content
export default {
  // configuration items
};
```

  }
}
```

## locales

- Default: `[['en-US', 'English'], ['zh-CN', '中文']]`
- Details:

The configuration is a two-dimensional array, and the first item of array will be the default locale of the site.

Each item of configuration is an array of length 2. The first item value of the array represents the name of the locale, which will be used to splice the routing prefix and detect the locale of the file name. The second value represents the label of the locale, which will be used presented options when switching languages.

The file name suffix of the default locale is optional. For example, in the default configuration, `index.md` and `index.en-US.md` are equivalent.

## mode

- Type: `doc | site`
- Default: `doc`
- Details:

This configuration is used to set the document presented mode. The default is document mode (left menu + right content). It can be switched to site mode (navigation header + left menu + right content) by configured it as `site`. If you want to modify the text and order of the navigation menu items, you can refer to the `nav` configurations in the frontmatter.

The effects of the two modes can be seen in [Guide - Modes](/guide/mode)。

## menus

- Type: `Object`
- Default: `automatic generated`
- Details:

```js
export default {
  navs: [
    {
      title: 'IHaveSubNavigation',
      path: 'path is optional',
      children: [
        { title: 'firstItem', path: 'https://d.umijs.org' },

### includes
